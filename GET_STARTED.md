# Get Started in 5 Minutes

This is your fastest path to getting the MySQL to SmartSuite sync running.

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Docker installed (for test database)
- [ ] SmartSuite API token and account ID
- [ ] 5 minutes of time

## Step 1: Install (1 minute)

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Or manually:
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
cp config/sync_mappings.example.yml config/sync_mappings.yml
```

## Step 2: Start Test Database (1 minute)

```bash
# Start MySQL with sample data
make docker-up

# Or manually:
docker-compose up -d
```

This creates a MySQL database with:
- 5 sample customers
- 7 sample orders

## Step 3: Configure (2 minutes)

### Edit `.env`

```bash
# Only change these two lines:
SMARTSUITE_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
SMARTSUITE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_actual_account_id_here

# Everything else is already configured for test database
```

### Edit `config/sync_mappings.yml`

```yaml
# Find this line (appears twice, once for customers, once for orders):
table_id: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TABLE_ID"

# Replace with your SmartSuite table ID
table_id: "abc123xyz"  # Your actual table ID
```

**How to get table ID**: Open your table in SmartSuite, look at the URL:
```
https://app.smartsuite.com/.../{TABLE_ID_HERE}/...
```

## Step 4: Test (30 seconds)

```bash
# Test all connections
make test

# You should see:
# âœ“ MySQL connection successful
# âœ“ Found 5 customers in database
# âœ“ SmartSuite client initialized
# âœ“ State manager initialized
```

## Step 5: First Sync (30 seconds)

```bash
# Run your first sync!
make run

# Watch it sync records from MySQL to SmartSuite
```

Check SmartSuite - your records should be there!

## What Just Happened?

1. âœ… Queried MySQL for customer and order data
2. âœ… Mapped MySQL fields to SmartSuite fields
3. âœ… Created records in SmartSuite
4. âœ… Saved mappings to local SQLite database

## Try It Again

```bash
# Run sync again
make run

# This time all records will be SKIPPED
# (because nothing changed - that's idempotency!)
```

## Make a Change

```bash
# Update a customer in MySQL
make mysql-shell

# In MySQL shell:
UPDATE customers SET company = 'New Company Name' WHERE id = 1;
exit

# Run sync again
make run

# You should see:
# - 1 record UPDATED (the one you changed)
# - Other records SKIPPED (unchanged)
```

## Start Over (Reset Everything)

Want to test from scratch? Use the reset command:

```bash
# Reset MySQL and sync state to fresh start
make reset

# This will:
# - Backup your current state
# - Delete sync state database
# - Clear logs
# - Reset MySQL to original sample data
# - Let you test the first sync again!
```

## Next Steps

### Run on a Schedule

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes (Ctrl+C to stop)
make schedule
```

### View Status

```bash
# See sync history
make status

# View logs
make logs
```

### Configure Your Real Database

Edit `.env` and change MySQL settings:

```bash
MYSQL_HOST=your.database.host
MYSQL_USER=your_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database
```

Edit `config/sync_mappings.yml`:
- Update SQL queries
- Map your actual fields
- Add field transformations

### Deploy to Production

See [README.md](README.md) for:
- SystemD service setup
- Docker deployment
- Cron scheduling
- Production best practices

## Useful Commands

```bash
make help              # Show all commands
make validate          # Check configuration
make status            # Show sync history
make logs              # View recent logs
make reset             # Reset to fresh start (MySQL + state)
make docker-down       # Stop test database
make backup            # Backup state database
make clean             # Clean up files
```

## Common Issues

### "Can't connect to MySQL"
```bash
# Check if MySQL is running
docker-compose ps

# Restart if needed
make docker-down
make docker-up
```

### "SmartSuite 401 Unauthorized"
- Check your API token in `.env`
- Make sure it's not expired
- Verify token has correct permissions

### "Table not found"
- Check `table_id` in `config/sync_mappings.yml`
- Make sure table exists in SmartSuite
- Verify you have access to the table

### "Field not found"
- Check field slugs match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Go to table settings in SmartSuite
- Copy the exact field slug
